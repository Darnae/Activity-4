# Activity-4
Seconds Conversion

For this activity I was instructed to build a windows form that prompts the user to enter seconds elased, then convert those seconds into minutes, hours, and Days. As shown with one of my screen shots I did this through the user of multiple IF statements. I have a button that prompts the user to enter seconds. When pressed this button generates a random number of seconds then converts those seconds into the appropriate vaules in the appropriate text boxes. Along with a preview of my form in action, I have provided three screenshots of three test runs of the program running.

The First Screenshot is of my code for the program.
